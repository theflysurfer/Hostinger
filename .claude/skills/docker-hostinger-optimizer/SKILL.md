# Docker Container Optimizer

Optimize Docker containers using industry best practices for size, security, and performance.

## Usage

Use this skill when you need to optimize Docker containers. The skill will guide you through progressive optimization steps.

## How it works

This skill analyzes your Docker setup and applies proven optimization techniques:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Reviews current Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
2. **Quick Wins**: Applies immediate optimizations (base image, layer combining)
3. **Advanced Optimizations**: Multi-stage builds, non-root users, resource limits
4. **Validation**: Tests optimized containers and measures improvements

## Examples

- "Optimize my Python API container"
- "Make this Node.js Docker image smaller"
- "Improve security of my application containers"
- "Reduce Docker build time for ML application"

## Progressive Disclosure

The skill starts with simple optimizations and progressively reveals advanced techniques based on your needs and context.
